Ques. What are the key things you would consider when creating/consuming an API
      to ensure that it is secure and reliable?

Ans : When creating or consuming an API, ensuring its security and reliability is critical.
      Key considerations include:

   1. Authentication and Authorization
        Without authentication, anyone could access your API.
        Without authorization, users might access things they shouldn't.
        So we add authentication so that the person allowed to access only can,if he/she is
        authorized too.

   2. Input Validation and Sanitization
        Validation checks wheather the data provided is correct, and sanitization is to check
        for harmful content.
        Spring Boot provides `@Valid` to check for Validation.

   3. Secure Communication
        Encrypt data using HTTPS, Without encryption,
        sensitive data (like passwords) could be stolen during transmission.

   4. Rate Limiting and Throttling
        Rate limiting controls how many requests a user can make in a given time.
        Throttling slows down or blocks users who send too many requests.

   5. Error Handling
        Error handling is about telling users what went wrong in a graceful manner.
        Always try to return user-friendly error messages.

   6. Logging and Monitoring
        Logging records API activity (e.g., who accessed it and when).
        Monitoring watches for unusual behavior or errors.So that we can know the
        API is functioning the way it was supposed to.

### 2. Theoretical Challenge

Suppose you have a CSV file with the data below.
A1: 5, A2: 7, A3: 9, B1: 3, B2: 8, B3: =4+5, C1: =5+A1, C2: =A2+B2, C3: =C2+B3
I want a program that will take the CSV input above and produce CSV output with the results. If
it is a value, then return a value. If it is a formula then calculate the formula and return the
value of that formula.

1. How will you tackle the challenge above?
   Answer : So what we have to do is 1. First read the input and convert it into a 2D Array Matrix. 2. Now use a pattern matcher to identify where the formula lies in the matrix 3. Replace the cell references in the fromula with the actual cell values 4. Write the result back into csv file with the evaluated values.

2. What type of errors you would you check for?
   Answwer : 1. Circular References : A formaula whch refers to a formula which refers bacvk to itself.
   There would be no way of finding the bvalue in such case. 2. Invalid References : A formula references a non-existential cell. 3. Invalid formula : A formula having an incorrect syntax 4. Not well formatted file structure. 5. Handling divide by zero errors.

3. How might a user break your code?
   Answer : 1. Large Files: The user provides a CSV file with thousands of rows, causing memory or performance issues. 2. Complex Dependencies: A cell depends on many other cells, leading to a deep recursion or slow evaluation. 3. Non-Standard Formulas: A user provides formulas with unsupported operators or functions. 4. Special Characters in Values: Data contains commas or quotes that interfere with CSV parsing.
